My code starts by creating a sum variable set to 0 and
 reading the file name from stdin

 Then, we iterate through each line in the file adding positive numbers while ignoring
 negatives, and breaking if it reads the value -999. 
 This part is done with an if,elif, and else statement inside of a for loop
